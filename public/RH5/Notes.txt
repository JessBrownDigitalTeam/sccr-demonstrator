Notes on test Json files

Files with a hyphen followed by a number e.g. Condition9449303789-1.json are the individual resource
Files with just the nhs number e.g. Condition9449303789.json is the Bundle for the individual resources

In the bundle files i have put a url link back to the individual resource files, though not sure this is needed
